A mod focused solely on deer-like creatures.
Some of the animals in this mod are taken straight from my other, outdated mod called "Steve's Animals". I am breaking that old mod up into its constituent parts with new and improves code, textures, and behavior.

Currently, there are 4. The Scire, Infernihart, Auravine, and Mirelung.

Compatibilities:
- *good to add mid-save
- Alpha Implants
- Alpha Biomes
- Regrowth: Core
- Regrowth: Aspen Forest
- Regrowth: Boiling Forest
- Medieval Overhaul
- More Vanilla Biomes

Incompatibilities:
- *shouldn't be any :)
- reports without proper logs will be ignored as per my last email

Features:
- All species have sexual dimorphism to some degree meaning the males and females have different physical characteristics such as colors and patterns.
- Each species has unique immunities to various afflictions which can be passed on to masters.
- Some species have random antler pairings for more variation in the male sex.
- Some species gain movement boosts during certain weather anomalies as well.
- Members of the same species will also fight each other over territorial disputes from time to time.
- Each species has corresponding genes for immunizations and skin color.
